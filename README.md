# ark-chat

This repository contains some code for providing a chat-functionality for [ark](https://github.com/locator-kn/ark).
It basically creates documents which represent a conversation.
You can also retrieve all conversations, the requesting user is participating.

You can send messages to a particular conversation.

This plugin connects to the [ark-realtime-plugin](https://github.com/locator-kn/ark-realtime) which takes care about websocket-connections.
